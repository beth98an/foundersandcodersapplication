                            While studying at university I had the oppportunity to take part in a wearable electronics workshop 
                            in which I learnt how to design, build and program a small wearable electronic device with LEDs that flash to the beat of music.
                            The video below demonstrates what I made.

                    <h1>Why I am applying for this programme</h1>
                    <p>
                        Before starting my degree, I had no idea about what career I wanted to pursue after I had finished. 
                        But during my second year at university I discovered that I have a passion for computer programming when I was taught how to use python. 
                        Since graduating, I have decided that I would like a career in computer programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would be a dream come true to explore and learn more programming languages and build on what I have already learnt from university and the self-teaching that I have done so far. 
                        Also, it would be great to meet other similar minded people with whom I can discuss programming, and I believe this course will give me the exciting opportunity to do this. 
                        Although programming can be frustrating and challenging at times, I find that the excitement and rush I get after I succeed makes it all worthwhile.
